- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @vokashlob, this oddish username comes from my_last_name.reverse(), where my_last_name = bolshakov # 'sh' is a single letter in russian. Oh, yes, I'm russian from Moscow.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m >20 years experienced theatre director and teacher interested in ML & DL (just for myself, not for theatre needs yet). And I'm ok with math and Python to do this.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning DL in OTUS (https://otus.ru)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: feel free to contact me on social networcs (FB, VK, LI) with 'vokashlob' as username.
